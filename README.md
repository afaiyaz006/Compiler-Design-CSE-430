## Lexical analyzer
```
python lexical.py <program.c
```
Lexical Analyzer:A lexical analyzer is a component of a compiler or interpreter that reads the source code, identifies and groups meaningful parts of code (tokens), 
and filters out unnecessary elements like whitespace and comments to prepare the code for further processing.


## Symbol table

```
python symbol_table.py
```
A symbol table is a data structure used in computer science and compiler design to store and manage information about symbols (identifiers) in a program. Symbols typically refer to variables, constants, functions, classes, or any other named entities in the source code of a programming language.

### Left recursion removal

```
python left_recursion_elimination_algorithm.py
```
A left recursion removal algorithm is a technique used in formal grammar processing, particularly in parsing and compiler construction. Its purpose is to eliminate left recursion from a set of production rules, as left recursion can lead to infinite loops in parsing.


### Find First follow

```
python first_follow.py
```
