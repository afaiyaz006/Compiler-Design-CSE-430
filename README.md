## Lexical analyzer
```
python lexical.py <program.c
```
Lexical Analyzer:A lexical analyzer is a component of a compiler or interpreter that reads the source code, identifies and groups meaningful parts of code (tokens), 
and filters out unnecessary elements like whitespace and comments to prepare the code for further processing.


## Symbol table

```
python symbol_table.py
```
